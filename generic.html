										<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/tasks-data-analyst-ss.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! My name is Olaniyi Bello, a seasoned Data Analyst deeply committed to harnessing the transformative
										 power of data to drive strategic decision-making and operational excellence. With over four years of robust experience across various sectors, 
										 I specialise in translating complex datasets into actionable insights that propel business growth and efficiency.</p>
									<p>My expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of technical skills and methodologies, including advanced data manipulation with SQL, robust data visualisation
										 using Power BI and Tableau, and predictive analytics through Python. I am adept in data cleaning, transformation, and the execution of sophisticated 
										 Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes. My career has equipped me with the skills to perform comprehensive statistical analyses, develop dynamic data
										  models, and generate impactful visualisations that highlight trends and inform strategic directions..</p>

									<h2>My Past Experience</h2>
									<p>Throughout my professional journey, I have had the privilege of contributing to diverse roles, each enriching my skill set and perspective. Starting my career at
										NNPC as an Apprenticeship Data Analyst, I was instrumental in optimising data collection methods and enhancing report accuracy, which significantly improved 
										decision-making processes. Later, as a Junior Data Analyst, I collaborated on projects that utilised Excel and Tableau to analyse data from multiple business sectors,
										contributing to a 20% overall increase in ROI. As a Data Associate at 10ALYTICS UK, I led initiatives that improved data integration efficiency and quality, directly
										enhancing decision-making processes. My tenure as an Energy Research Analyst at Teesside University allowed me to dive deep into energy data, identifying efficiencies
										that significantly reduced costs and improved production processes. As a Business Intelligence Analyst at M.Ola-Oluwa NIG LTD, I utilised my skills to enhance marketing
										strategies and operational workflows, directly contributing to improved profitability and stakeholder satisfaction..</p>
									<p>Each role has honed my ability to navigate complex data environments and deliver solutions that are not only strategic but also pragmatic and sustainable. My analytical 
										prowess, coupled with a proactive approach to stakeholder engagement, enables me to transform raw data into strategic assets that drive competitive advantage and
										operational improvements..</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Technical Proficiency</h2>
									<p>In my arsenal of competencies, I excel in data reporting, visualisation, stakeholder engagement, and trend identificationâ€”all crucial for translating analytical findings
										into strategic insights. My ability to manage projects, improve processes, and harness data for decision-making has consistently driven tangible improvements in business
										intelligence and customer relations. This expertise is underpinned by my fluency in an array of technical tools. I am proficient in using Power BI, Tableau, and advanced
										Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualisation; Python, SQL, DAX, and M-language for programming and queries; and tools like Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy
										for statistical computing and data manipulation. This comprehensive technical toolkit enables me to navigate the complexities of data management and ETL processes
										efficiently, ensuring that I can meet and exceed the demands of dynamic business environments.</p>
